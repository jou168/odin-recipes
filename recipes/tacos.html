    <p>Beef-stew dipping sauce with crispy taco shells and soft tender beef</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 pounds boneless chuck</li>
        <li> 1 pound oxtail or bone-in short ribs</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon neutral oil</li>
        <li> 7 ancho chiles</li>
        <li> 7 guajillo chiles</li>
        <li> 3 chiles de arbol</li>
        <li> 1 white onion</li>
        <li> 6 garlic cloves</li>
        <li> 4 roma tomatoes</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon black peppercorns</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon coriander seeds</li>
        <li> 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        <li> 1/2 Mexican cinnamon stick</li>
        <li> 3 bay leaves</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li> 3 cups beef broth or water</li>
        <li> 1/4 cup minced cilantro</li>
        <li> 1/4 white onion</li>
        <li> Juice from 1 lime</li>
        <li> Kosher salt </li>
        <li> Corn tortillas</li>
        <li> 3 ounces Oaxacan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring meat to room temperature and then salt it liberally.</li>
        <li>In a large pot that has an oven-proof lid, place it over medium-high heat. You’re probably going to have to do this in batches, 
            but sear the meat on both sides for about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the meat to a bowl and then repeat with the remaining pieces of meat.</li>
        <li>Then you’re add the chiles, tomatoes, onions, spices and garlic to a pot. Cover the chiles and everything with water and simmer for about 
            20 minutes. We want the tomatoes and chiles very softened.</li>
        <li>Drain it and then transfer everything to a blender, along with a cup or two of beef broth or water. Blend it up until super smooth. </li>
        <li>Add the meat back to the large pot and pour the sauce over it. Pour 1 cup of broth in the blender and swish it back in forth (to pick up any 
            extra sauce) and pour it into the pot. Bring it to a gentle simmer and then cover. Transfer the pot to the oven to braise for about 3 to 3 1/2 hours, 
            until the meat shreds easily. </li>
        <li>Remove the meat from the sauce and shred it with two forks.</li>
        <li>Add some of the sauce (the consomé) to a bowl and add a little beef broth if it needs to be thinned out.</li>
        <li>Mince up some onion and cilantro and mix it in a small bowl with a few squeezes of lime and a pinch of salt. </li>
        <li>Add a spoonful of the cilantro and onion mixture to the consomé and add a squeeze of lime.</li>
        <li>Dip a corn tortilla into the top of the sauce. This should be mostly fat. And add it to a non-stick skillet, set over medium-high heat. </li>
        <li>Flip over and then add a small handful of shredded meat and a handful of Oaxacan cheese. Shape it into a quesadilla/taco.
             And flip it over so it can get crispy and melty on the other side.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a baking sheet and place in a 200F oven while you work your way through the rest of the Birria tacos.</li> 
    </ol>
